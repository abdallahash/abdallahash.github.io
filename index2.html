                Hello Pythoneer, I know you might think programming in python or in general is hard. But that is not your fault because let me ask you, why wouldn't it be if you are learning it the wrong way? 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Spending countless time and effort learning from long and repetitive textbooks that after you read 400-500 pages you still don’t know how to code which is your main point right?  
            </p>
            <p>
                Then it feels like you have been learning about Python and how good it is but not actually building something.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Also being in a lecture class and just listening to what the teacher has to say and looking at his slides without actually applying what you have learned does not get you anywhere. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Did you know that the two most inefficient ways to learn are reading and just listening according to the learning cone by Edgar Dale? We humans learn best by doing just like how we learned to walk and ride a bicycle.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                By using this same concept we are going to learn by my VISUALIZATION method to learn.
                Basically, we will make sure to make things simple and learn each concept visually by building practical projects that would help you understand better.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Even if you are just getting started. I want you to imagine if you could improve your coding ability, join your favorite Bootcamp, have projects on your portfolio, or even if you want to get better results I'm going to make sure you move it to the next level. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Or you might be facing a challenging problem and went to solve it looking for answers on YouTube and read some articles, but there is still some missing information that you can’t find anywhere and you just need that person to guide you through it step by step to find that missing link you were looking for. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                    Over the past year, I have helped many people from different backgrounds like university students, beginners, and even senior developers to move past their programming challenges with python.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                    So, if you care about your future and your education (because it is important to me), I'm going to give you 30 minutes free consultation time for you to decide if we are going to be a great fit for each other and you liked the way I deliver value.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                    To give you more flexible time and hands-on experience we are going to have all of our sessions online using online calling platforms like zoom or skype which will allow us to code everything live. Nothing excites me more than getting you the results that you wanted.
